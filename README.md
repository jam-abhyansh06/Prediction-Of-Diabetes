# Prediction-Of-Diabetes

This machine learning model predicts whether a person is diabetic or not based on the features provided in the dataset.
The dataset hused in this model if of PIMA.
It implements Random Forest Classifier algorithm.
And further implements Hyperparameters optimization technique also.
