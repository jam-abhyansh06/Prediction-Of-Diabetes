# Prediction-Of-Diabetes

This machine learning model predicts whether a person is diabetic or not based on the features provided in the dataset.<br/>
The dataset hused in this model of PIMA.<br/>
It implements Random Forest Classifier algorithm.<br/>
And further implements Hyperparameters optimization technique also.
